# Welcome 👋

Hayo, welcome to my GitHub 🐙! Here you'll find a myriad of random things I'm working on, so feel free to sleuth 🕵 around. **Before you move on**, here's one very important thing you should know first...

# Projects 🤖

I don't have a ton in here currently, but the future is bright for this repo. Here's a quick overview of the projects I'm working on.

### ezverse

I'm working on a collection of packages (all prefixed with 'ez') that are supposed to make various aspects of data science, automated reporting, and data exploration much easier (ez... get it?). Current state looks like this:

* **ezxfig** - Easily transform data frames
  * xfig comes from the word transfigure, meaning "transform into something more beautiful or elevated". Kind of lame but I liked it, and ezxfig sort of rolls off the tongue
* **ezexplore** - Easily explore data sets and produce summary statistics
* **ezdates** - Easily manipulate dates and define date ranges
* **ezviz** - Easily configure `formattable` tables for aesthetically pleasing table output
* **ezextras** - Easily... idk but these certainly make coding quicker

### Shiny Apps

I haven't really done anything with this yet, but I'm planning on creating multilple shiny apps, one of which visualizes and summarizes data out of the census API

### Lamps

This repo is just for random projects and analyses that I work on. There's nothing in there currently except for some code that I transfered into the `ezverse`
