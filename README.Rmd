# Welcome 👋

Hayo, welcome to my GitHub 🐙 ! Here you'll find a myriad of random things I'm working on. **Before you move on**, there's one important thing you should know...

That said, if you have any questions, want to collaborate on a project, or find an issue with my code, feel free to submit an issue in GitHub or hit me up at any of the following:

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjlamphere/) - I'm relatively active on linkedIn, so if we work together on something, let's connect
* [Email](ericjlamphere@gmail.com) - Most likely to get a response
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericlamphere) - I don't really use it a ton, but you can send me cool things or questions here and I'll see them eventually

# Projects 🤖

I don't have a ton in here currently, but the future is bright for these projects. Here's a quick overview of the projects I'm working on.

<!-- badges: end -->

I'm working on a collection of packages (all prefixed with 'ez') that are supposed to make various aspects of data science and analytics engineering much ~ez~easier. Current state looks like this:

* [**ezxfig**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezxfig.git) - Easily transform data frames
  * "xfig" comes from the word "transfigure", meaning "transform into something more beautiful or elevated". Kind of lame but I liked it
* [**ezexplore**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezexplore.git) - Easily explore data sets and produce summary statistics
* [**ezdates**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezdates.git) - Easily manipulate dates and define date ranges
* [**ezviz**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezviz.git) - Easily configure `formattable` tables for aesthetically pleasing table output
* [**ezextras**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezextras.git) - Easily... idk but these certainly make for quicker development times

Similar to the `tidyverse`, you can install and load all of the `ezverse` packages with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("EricLamphere/ezverse")
```


### Apps <a href='https://github.com/rstudio/shiny'><img src='images/app-store-logo-transparent.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>


I haven't gone too far with this yet, but here are the shells of a couple apps I have in mind:

* 🏘️ [**whats-the-census**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/whats-the-census.git) - R Shiny app that summarises and visualizes data from the census API
* ⚽ [**better-bets**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/better-bets.git) - An app for providing predictive analytics (via. the [Football Prediction API](https://rapidapi.com/boggio-analytics/api/football-prediction/) from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub)) for upcoming soccer games with the end goal of a more profitable and consistent betting system. Here's my vision for the stack:
  * Front-end: React
  * Web framework: Flask
  * API: GraphQL (Graphene)
  * Database: MongoDB (mongomock)
